# titanic analysis and modeling
In this repo I created a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. The objective of this project is to build a model to predict whether passengers on the Titanic would survive or not based on pattern extracted from analysing features.

<br>

* `survival`: Target column has two values (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
* `pclass`:	Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
* `sex`: male or female.
* `Age`: Age of passengers in years.	
* `sibsp`: number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic.	
* `parch`: number of parents / children aboard the Titanic.
* `ticket`:	Ticket number.
* `fare`: Passenger fare.
* `cabin`: Cabin number.	
* `embarked`: Port of Embarkation has three values (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)   

✔️ **These variables, in combination with appropriate statistical and machine learning techniques, can help predict whether passengers would survive or not.**
